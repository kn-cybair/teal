# Electronics and electrical circuits introduction course with Arduino programming for beginners

Project is focused on introducing the basics of electrical engineering and Arduino platform programming to inexperienced newcomers. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Prior knowledge 

Participants are welcome to have prior experience in C/C++ programming and High School physics, however it's not required.

#### Software and hardware

For efficient partaking you need to have an access to PC or Mac computer with either MS Windows, MAC OS or Linux installed. Arduino development environment is fine to run on all mainstream platforms.

Follow the link to install appropriate version of Arduino IDE on your computer: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

If you're attending our course at Poznan University of Technology, then probably you're provided with Arduino board and all other elements. If you're unable to participate personally, please contact us, we are eager to help you start out.

### Writing code

We recommend rather writing code by yourself - it's less error-prone, but you learn more about syntax and algorithms. After all, if you stuck, this repo is here to provide stable and correct code for you.
